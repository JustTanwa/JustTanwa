# About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Katakung95.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, gaming and anime. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development language and framework such as HTML5, CSS3 and JS. 

## My work
- I am currently completing various courses on FreeCodeCamp, so you will see various projects on my repository relating to them. Feel free to add comments and interact with me or my work.
- I have created some simple web apps, see [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://focused-wozniak-fe8d98.netlify.app/) and [MiniApps](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sleepy-ramanujan-3178c1/overview).

### My goals
